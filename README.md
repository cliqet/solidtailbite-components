Ready-to-use components for SolidJS styled with Tailwind CSS and some designs derived from Flowbite

This is just a hobby of mine where I plan on building ready-to-use functional UI components which may be useful when you are building your site. This is not the typical UI library that are available there. If you need those, then you may want to check them out. What I am trying to build are components that provide functionality aside from just being a UI component. This means you don't have to worry about how to implement the logic and state of these components. Everything is managed for you. You are the user though and you define how you will use it. These components will give you everything that is happening inside it so you only need to worry about building the part of your program that needs these components. It means these components are not designed to know what exactly you plan to do but exposes its functionality and events that you care about when interacting with them. They are free to use and you don't have to worry about customizing its style since the source code is provided so that you can customize its style or add more functionalities that I might have missed. You can view and read the docs on how the component works at [SolidTailBite Components](https://stellar-chimera-d82f55.netlify.app/)
